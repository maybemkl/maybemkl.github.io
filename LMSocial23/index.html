  <h3>NLP for Social Science: From Language Models to Social Structures</h3>
 
  <p>In recent years, deep neural language models of varying size and scope have impressed scientists and laypeople alike with their ability to model and generate natural language. While the social sciences have previously been quick to pick up computational text analysis tools, the adaptation of increasingly complex neural language modeling to applied research has been more hesitant. Many seem to wonder exactly how to leverage the strength of these models in the context of social inquiry, and about the reliability of the computational narratives they produce.</p>
  
  <p>For this first instantiation of the “NLP for Social Science” workshop organized at INCITE Columbia in collaboration with the Platial Analysis lab at McGill, we invite social and computer scientists to present empirical work in which language models–whether large or small–are applied to tell a meaningful story about the social world. We especially invite work that expands our imagination on the range of research designs and methods that the tools of language modeling enable for the social sciences. The workshop will be organized biweekly starting in early February and ending in the middle of May 2023.</p>
